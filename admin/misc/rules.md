This section may be used to record specific tasks or responsibilities particular team members have assumed.

6) Conflict Resolution

- If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to first talk to the member and assess why they are unable to meet deadlines. If necessary, we will redistribute the work if the team member is unable to complete it, or give them extra support to complete it, before bringing the issue to a TA or professor
- If we have a conflict in some feature, our team should discuss in the group to determine which idea is better and everyone all agrees with the idea.
- **NO** physical conflicts are allowed.

7) Expectations of Faculty and GTA's
 If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.

8) Team Signatures (_Include signature for each student_).
